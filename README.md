<b>About</b>  
Our main guide would be Micheal Hartl's Learn Web Development with Rails: https://www.railstutorial.org/  
Rails Application with a few API Endpoints for the Mobile Module  

<b>Note</b>  
Ruby on Rails isn't taught at iACADEMY so we apologize in advance.  
This is our team's first attempt (well, third "first attempt") to develop on Ruby on Rails.  

If you are an iACADEMY student looking to contact us:
